# This version of the Akka Persistence Coffee Shop relies on a postgres instance for its journal and snapshot storage.
# You can run an instance of Postgres at the expected ports and address with a simple docker instance like below. 

sudo docker build -t postgres_coffeeshop .
sudo docker  run -p 5432:5432 -d postgres_coffeeshop

# Then simply sbt "runMain com.chompchompfig.akka.Main" will run the Akka Persistence Coffee Shop

# If you are using Docker Toolbox from Windows you must perform a couple of additional steps
# Since you will be editing the code from Windows, but using the Dockerfile and some shell scripts from Linux, you must be 
# carefull with the different new line characters used in each system. The simplest thing is to tell Git to convert the new line
# characters to those of a Windows system, so you don't get all the source code messed up. Then you can revert this transformation for
# a couple of files that you will typically be using from Docker/Linux. You can use dos2unix from the Windows command line to convert
# these files back to Linux format.
# Convert Dockefile and all files under docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
# Finally, when you try to run the Main class from your windows host, don't forget to specify the correct container IP address. This is
# the IP addresss of the container running the Postgres instance correctly populated with Akka Persistence tables. Copy this IP address into
# src/main/resources/application.conf and replace the slick.db.host property with the correct value. Otherwise our running Akka program
# will not be able to find the Journal Store.

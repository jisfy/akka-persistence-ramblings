# This version of the Akka Persistence Coffee Shop relies on a postgres instance for its journal and snapshot storage.
# You can run an instance of Postgres at the expected ports and address with a simple docker instance like below. 

sudo docker build -t postgres_coffeeshop .
sudo docker  run -p 5432:5432 -d postgres_coffeeshop

# Then simply sbt "runMain com.chompchompfig.akka.Main" will run the Akka Persistence Coffee Shop
